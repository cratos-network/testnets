# Cratos Network Testnets

This repo collects the genesis Cratos Network Hub testnets. It exists so the [Cratos-SDK](https://github.com/cratos-network/cratos-sdk)
repo does not get bogged down with large genesis files and status updates.

__Recommended__: To keep up to date, always download from the *"/latest"* directory. Use this link: [genesis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cratos-network/testnets/master/latest/genesis.json)
